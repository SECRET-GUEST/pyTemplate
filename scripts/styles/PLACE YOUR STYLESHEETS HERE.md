**Instructions for Utilizing Style Files**

To maintain a sleek and functional user interface, please follow these steps regarding style files:

1. **File Placement:** Please place the style files in the appropriate folder. The files provided are: `style1.txt`, `style2.txt`, `style3.txt`, `style4.txt`, and `style5.txt`.

2. **Style File Formats:** These files can either be in CSS or QSS format, as Python can interpret both. However, using the CSS format is recommended for more extensive animation handling, allowing Python to manage the CSS autonomously.

3. **Importing Styles:** To import these style files into your program, use the following method in your Python script:

   ```python
   with open('path/to/your/stylefile.txt', 'r') as file:
       style = file.read()
       self.setStyleSheet(style)
   ```
   
   - Replace `'path/to/your/stylefile.txt'` with the actual path to your style file.
   - Repeat this process for each style file you wish to import.

4. **Applying Styles:** Apply the loaded style to your PyQt5 widget as follows:
   
   ```python
   yourWidget.setStyleSheet(style)
   ```

Remember to try out different styles to see which one best suits your application.
